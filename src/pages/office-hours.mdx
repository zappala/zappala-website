# Department Advising

[Lynnette Nelson](https://cs.byu.edu/department/directory/staff-directory/lynnette-nelson/)
is the CS Undergraduate Advisor. If you have questions about classes, CS
graduation requirements, department resources, retake policy, 142 waivers, etc.
[please make an appointment](https://cs.byu.edu/department/directory/staff-directory/lynnette-nelson/).
If she cannot directly help you with your question, she can point you to the
right person.

The [CS belonging mentors](https://diversity.cs.byu.edu/) are an amazing
resource. They meet with students that are struggling, provide help with
homework, give advice on resumes and job opportunities, connect students with
other resources on campus, and often just provide a listening ear.

is the CS Graduate Advisor. If you have questions about BYU's CS graduate
program, you can reach her at jen [at] cs.byu.edu. Jen is also the leader of the
Computer Science Belonging efforts. She leads the CS Belonging mentors.
