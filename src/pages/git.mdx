# Git for Beginners

Git is a version control system. This means you can use it to

- store code you write
- keep track of all your versions
- revert to an older version of your code
- collaborate with other people to write code
- keep track of who made what changes

This guide teaches you how to use Git via the command line. There are a variety
of GUIs, and Visual Studio Code has Git built in. I think it helps to learn
using the command line to really master the concepts.

## Installing Git

### On MacOS

The easiest way is to use the version that ships with MacOS:

```sh
git --version
```

This will prompt you to install `Xcode` if you haven't already. Once it is
installed you should see something like this:

```
git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)
```

If you really want the latest version, you can
[install Homewbrew](https://brew.sh/) and then use:

```sh
brew install git
```

### On Windows

Use [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), which will get you `Git BASH`
for a command line version.

### On Linux

Install with [your package manager](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux)

## Git Configuration

Do some basic configuration first:

```sh
git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
git config --global user.email "YOUR-EMAIL"
```

This way when you add code, git will associate your changes with your name and
email address.

You may also want to configure an editor that you will use to edit commit
messages:

```sh
git config --global core.editor "vim"
```

I prefer to use `vim`. If you skip this step, then you will use your system's
default editor.

## Git on your own machine

When you are working with Git on your own machine, your actions look like this:

![adding a document to a git staging area and then committing it to the repository](/images/git/git-on-your-machine.png)

- you _add_ new files and modified files to a staging area
- you _commit_ the staged files to the repository

Every project gets its own repository. So you were building an app to keep track
of ideas for writing a book, you would create a new repository for it.
Meanwhile, if you had a website you were building for a friend's knitting store,
you would likewise keep that in a separate repository.

## Working on a solo project

Let's start with a project that contains text files. This way we don't have to
worry about whether you have the right setup for a programming language.

Open a terminal. On MacOS, use the built-in terminal or any other terminal you
have installed. On Windows, use `Git Bash`.

```sh
mkdir poetry
cd poetry
git init
```

This:

- makes a directory called `poetry`
- changes into that directory
- initializes a Git repository

You should see a message after the last step:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/zappala/poetry/.git/
```

Take a look around:

```sh
ls -al
```

You should see something like this:

![a listing that shows a .git directory](/images/git/git-ls.png)

Git will store all of your versions in the hidden `.git` directory. If you list
what is there:

```sh
ls -al .git
```

you should see:

![a bunch of files and directories](/images/git/git-ls-git.png)

This is where git is keeping track of different versions of your code, along
with some configuration files. We won't go into the details of what is stored
here, just know that this is a _very_ important directory. It is Git repository.

### Add a file

Using your favorite editor, add a file to this project, called
`the-read-wheelbarrow.txt`, with the following poem:

```
so much depends
upon

a red wheel
barrow

glazed with rain
water

beside the white
chickens
```

This is
[a famous poem by William Carlos Williams](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45502/the-red-wheelbarrow).

Now type:

```sh
git status
```

You should see something like this:

![git status which files are modified](/images/git/git-status.png)

- You are on the `main` branch. We'll talk more about branches later.
- You have not committed any code yet. So your repository is empty.
- You have one file in the project that has never been added to the repository,
  so it is not being "tracked". This is the file you just added!

### Commit a file

To add this new file to your Git repository, type:

```sh
git add the-read-wheelbarrow.txt
```

Now check the status again:

```sh
git status
```

Now you should see the added file:

![git status shows file has been added](/images/git/git-status-added.png)

Notice how this says that your new file is a change _to be committed_. What you
have done is placed your file in a _staging_ area. This allows you to prepare a
set of changes carefully, including adding and removing files as you see fit,
before _committing_ those changes to your repository.

You can finalize your commit with:

```sh
git commit
```

This will open the editor you configured, e.g. `vim`, to edit a commit message:

![editor for a git commit message](/images/git/git-commit-editor.png)

You can enter a message here, save and quit, and then your commit is done:

![git commit result](/images/git/git-commit.png)

Notice how it tells you that you changed 1 file and inserted 11 lines.

For best practices, commit messages should contain details about exactly what
you are committing. If you're writing code, you might explain the new
functionality you have added, or the bug you have fixed. Detailed commit
messages help your team know exactly what you did, and can likewise help your
future self to remember what you were doing. We also often wrap commit messages
at 80 characters so they show up well on a terminal.

For very short commit messages, you may alernatively use:

```sh
git commit -m "Added a poem"
```

### Git log and show

Let's take a look at what we have done so far:

```sh
git log
```

You will see a log of all the commits you have made so far, which should be just
one:

![git log output](/images/git/git-log.png)

Each commit has a SHA-1 hash, giving it a unique identifier, an author, a date,
and a commit message. This uses a `pager`, so you need to type `q` to exit.

If you want to see more detail, add the `-p` flag, which stands for `patch`.
This shows you the details of what was added and removed, using a common patch
format.

```sh
git log -p
```

![git log deatiled output](/images/git/git-log-p.png)

All of the added lines are prefaced with a `+`.

### Make changes

Edit the poem and make some changes to it on several lines. Then run:

```sh
git status
```

![git shows a file that has been modified](/images/git/git-status-change.png)

This shows that git sees that the file has been modified. You can commit the
change in one line with:

```sh
git commit -a
```

or

```sh
git commit -a -m "changed a few lines"
```

depending on whether you want to use the editor. The `-a` flag tells git to
automatically stage and then commit all files that have been modified. We did
not need to use `git add` to add any new files.

You should see:

![git shows the commit result](/images/git/git-commit-modified.png)

You can also view the log to see the changes:

```sh
git log -p
```

![git shows added and removed lines](/images/git/git-log-p-modified.png)

Notice how Git shows your changes in patch format, with removed and added lines.

When you build up a commit history, you have a chain of versions:

![git versions](/images/git/git-versions.png)

We'll talk about how to access those older versions later.

## GitHub

Git is a _distributed_ version control system. When you work on a team, you can
share repositories through a central system, such as GitHub, GitLab, or
BitBucket. In that case, you and your teammates are synchronizing your
repositories with the service you are using:

![two people sharing a repository through GitHub](/images/git/git-distributed-version-control.png)

### Getting started with GitHub

To start with GitHub, you'll need to
[create an account on GitHub](https://github.com/signup).

Once you do that, you should
[add an SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

- You can first
  [check to see if you have an existing SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
- If you don't have a key already, you can
  [generate an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

### Pushing an existing repository to GitHub

We're going to take your poetry repository and push it to GitHub. To start,
create a new repo by clicking this button in the top left:

![new repository button](/images/git/github-new-repo.png)

Fill out the form, but **don't click the box to add a README**. You do need to
decide whether your repository will be public or private.

- A _public_ repository means anyone can see your code and make a copy (fork
  it), but they cannot change it.
- A _private_ repository means nobody can see your code.
- In both cases, you can add collaborators who are authorized to make changes.

Once you are done creating the repository as described above, you will have an
_empty_ repository. Then you'll see these instructions:

![instructions for pushing to the new repo](/images/git/github-empty-repo.png)

Since you have an existing repository, follow the bottom instructions:

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:zappala/poetry.git
git push -u origin main
```

(Note there is another command GitHub proposes to rename the "master" branch to
"main". But your repository probably already uses "main" for the new branch.
This is part of a larger movement to remove "master/slave" terminology from
computer science, because it is insensitive, and instead using "main" or
"primary" and "secondary" or "backup" instead.)

- The first command _adds a remote_ repository to your configuration. This lets
  you sychronize the repository on your local machine with the one you just
  created on GitHub.

- The second command _pushes_ your local repository to the remote repository.
  This will copy all the versions you have created to the remote repository so
  they are identical.

### Working with GitHub

Try this out:

- Add or edit your files locally
- Use `git add`, `git commit -am "message"` to commit locally
- Use `git push` to push to GitHub
- Visit your repository on GitHub to see the changes

Normally if you are working alone on a project, every time you _push_ it will
succeed. However, if you are working on a team, conflicts could arise. We'll
discuss that later.

### Cloning a repository on GitHub

You can _clone_ a repository by using the `git clone` command. To start, find a
repository you want to clone. You can use
[this small test repo](https://github.com/zappala/gittest).

Click the `Code` button:

![code button shows you can clone with HTTPS or SSH](/images/git/github-clone.png)

Normally, you should use `SSH` to clone. Alternatively, you could setup access
tokens if you want to use `HTTPS`.

For example, you can clone this repository with:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:zappala/poetry.git
```

### Working with a friend

Now practice using GitHub with a friend:

- Go to your `poetry` repository on GitHub.
- Visit `Settings→Collaborators` and use the `Add people` button to add your
  friend.
- Give them write access.
- Have your friend add a new poem in a new file and push to your website
- Visit GitHub to see their new file.
- Use `git pull` to pull the changes and sync with your local repository
- Now you add a file and push, and have them pull.

### Resolving conflicts

Often, you will have teammates making changes at the same time. If you make
conflicting changes, you'll end up with a Git _conflict_. Let's show you how to
resolve this.

- With your friend, each of you edit one of the poems on your laptop. Make
  conflicting changes.
- Commit your changes to your local repository.
- Have one of you do a `git push`. This will succeed.
- Now have the other person do a `git push`. You should see a message like this:

```
Merge branch 'master' of git@github.com:username/repository.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:username/repository.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first merge the remote changes (e.g.,
hint: 'git pull') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

Let's talk about what this means!

- Your push was "rejected" because git could not automatically merge in your
  changes with your friend's changes.
- The remote repository (on GitHub) has some changes (from your friend) that you
  don't have in your local repository.

Since your local repository is not synchronized with the remote repository on
GitHub, you need to pull in those changes. Try using `git pull`. You'll now see
something like this:

```
remote: Counting objects: 8, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Total 8 (delta 0), reused 2 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (8/8), done.
From git@github.com:username/repository.git
   153782f..10e0b68  main     -> origin/main
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in poem.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

At this point, any files listed with `CONFLICT` next to them will have _both_
your code and your friend's code. They will be clearly marked! And Visual Studio
Code has a really nice
[3-way merge editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_3way-merge-editor)
to help you resolve the conflict.

If you look at the file with a conflict, you will see something like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
your friend's line of poetry
=======
your line of poetry
>>>>>>> (commit hash)
```

You can see the markers: `<`, `=`, and `>` marking the different versions.
Choose which version you want, delete the lines with markers, and use
`git commit` to commit the change. Now you can use `git push` to push the fixed
version, and your friend can use `git pull` to get the new version.

## Branches

If we have time, we'll follow the Git Book to learn about
[Git Branches in a Nutshell](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)
and
[Git Branching - Basic Branching and Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).

Once you understand branching, you can consider a basic branching strategy. See
for example:

- [Creating a Branching Strategy for Small Teams](https://adevait.com/software/creating-branching-strategy)
- [Git branching for small teams](https://dev.to/victoria/git-branching-for-small-teams-2n64)

## Checking out an old version

You can look at any of these versions using the commit hash. For example:

```sh
git checkout 640be78fe2dedc17df8771037d4892040c7e5014
```

If your editor is open, you'll likely see the file you are editing revert to its
older version. Git will warn you that you have checked out an old version:

![git tells you that you have checked out an old version](/images/git/git-checkout-old-version.png)

You can go back to the original with `git checkout main`.

## GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a GUI, you can use integrations in Visual Studio Code, or you can
try [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
