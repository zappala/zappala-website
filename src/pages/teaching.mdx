# Teaching

I strive to keep all my class materials available online, including syllabi,
assignments, and code.

My current assignments:

- [CS 110 How to Program](https://byucs110.org/): This is an intoduction to
  programming and computer science for those with no prior programming
  experience. Labs provide a supportive environment to learn how to program with
  peers.

- [CS 465 Introduction to Computer Security and Privacy](https://cs465.internet.byu.edu):
  Fundamental principles of computer security, including cryptography, systems,
  and software security.

- UNIV 101 BYU Foundations for Student Success

- CS 191 Exploring CS

I have a [small tutorial on how to use Git](/git) that I put together for a
skillathon sponsored by our Women in Computer Science club.
