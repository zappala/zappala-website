I lead the [Usable Security and Privacy Lab](https://internet.byu.edu), where
our goal is to help people protect their security and privacy online. Our
research is human-centered, meaning we collaborate with people to understand and
design for their needs.

I currently teach [CS 110 How to Program](https://byucs110.org/), CS 465
Introduction to Security and Privacy, and lead the
[Early Research Scholars Program](https://ersp.byu.edu/).

I have been a professor at Brigham Young University since 2004. Prior to that I
was a professor at the University of Oregon. I received my PhD from the
University of Southern California in 1997, where I was advised by Dr. Deborah
Estrin. I was also very fortunate to work with Lixia Zhang, Scott Shenker, and
Bob Braden. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford
University.

One of the beautiful things about life in academia is you can change your
research interests over time. I orginally started in networking, especially
focused on new network services such as multicast and resource reservations.
Over time this led to research in peer-to-peer networking and wireless networks.
Later in my career I switched to security research, which has included projects
in network security, applied cryptography, and usable security and privacy. I am
currently trying to focus on helping people first, with technology being
secondary to that goal.

I did not start out imagining a career in academia and feel lucky to have found
my way here, because I enjoy helping students grow and reach their potential. I
highly recommend figuring out life as you live it. Don't be afraid to ask
questions and explore new things.
