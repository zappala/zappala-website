I lead the [Usable Security and Privacy Lab](https://internet.byu.edu), where
our goal is to help people protect their security and privacy online. Our
research is human-centered, meaning we collaborate with people to understand and
design for their needs.

I currently teach [CS 110 How to Program](https://byucs110.org/), CS 465
Introduction to Security and Privacy, and lead the
[Early Research Scholars Program](https://ersp.byu.edu/).

I have been a professor at Brigham Young University since 2004. Prior to that I
was a professor at the University of Oregon. I received my PhD from the
University of Southern California in 1997, where I was advised by Dr. Deborah
Estrin. I was also very fortunate to work with Lixia Zhang, Scott Shenker, and
Bob Braden. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford
University.

One of the beautiful things about life in academia is you can change your
research interests over time. I orginally started in networking, especially
focused on new network services such as multicast and resource reservations.
Over time this led to research in peer-to-peer networking and wireless networks.
Later in my career I switched to security research, which has included projects
in network security, applied cryptography, and usable security and privacy. I am
currently trying to focus on helping people first, with technology being
secondary to that goal.

I did not start out imagining a career in academia and feel lucky to have found
my way here, because I enjoy helping students grow and reach their potential. I
highly recommend figuring out life as you live it. Don't be afraid to ask
questions and explore new things.

# Department Advising

[Lynnette Nelson](https://cs.byu.edu/department/directory/staff-directory/lynnette-nelson/)

If she cannot directly help you with your question, she can point you to the

The [CS belonging mentors](https://diversity.cs.byu.edu/) are an amazing
resource. They meet with students that are struggling, provide help with
homework, give advice on resumes and job opportunities, connect students with
other resources on campus, and often just provide a listening ear.
