I lead the [Usable Security and Privacy Lab](https://internet.byu.edu), where
our goal is to help people protect their security and privacy online. Our
research is human-centered, meaning we collaborate with people to understand and
design for their needs.

I currently teach [CS 110 How to Program](https://byucs110.org/), CS 465
Introduction to Security and Privacy, and lead the
[Early Research Scholars Program](https://ersp.byu.edu/).

# Advising and Office Hours

I am the CS Faculty Advisor. I can help you with:

- advice on which major or emphasis might fit you,
- electives that fit your plans,
- career advice,
- transfer credit and course substitutions, and
- general advice navigating the CS program.

If I am your instructor for a class this semester, you are of course also
welcome to come to office hours for help with the class you are taking from me,
or any other advice.

You can use Calendly to
[schedule an appointment with me](https://calendly.com/daniel-zappala).

# Department Advising

[Lynnette Nelson](https://cs.byu.edu/department/directory/staff-directory/lynnette-nelson/)
is the CS Undergraduate Advisor. If you have questions about classes, CS
graduation requirements, department resources, retake policy, 142 waivers, etc.
[please make an appointment](https://cs.byu.edu/department/directory/staff-directory/lynnette-nelson/).
If she cannot directly help you with your question, she can point you to the
right person.

The [CS belonging mentors](https://diversity.cs.byu.edu/) are an amazing
resource. They meet with students that are struggling, provide help with
homework, give advice on resumes and job opportunities, connect students with
other resources on campus, and often just provide a listening ear.

[Jen Bonnett](https://cs.byu.edu/department/directory/staff-directory/jennifer-bonnett/)
is the CS Graduate Advisor. If you have questions about BYU's CS graduate
program, you can reach her at jen [at] cs.byu.edu. Jen is also the leader of the
Computer Science Belonging efforts. She leads the CS Belonging mentors.
