I lead the [Usable Security and Privacy Lab](https://internet.byu.edu), where
our goal is to help people protect their security and privacy online. Our
research is human-centered, meaning we collaborate with people to understand and
design for their needs.

Some of our current projects include:

- Studying how people apply mental models and threat models to understand and
  reason about new authentication technologies.

- Understanding how Passkeys is being rolled out as a new authentication
  service.

- Identifying how usable security and privacy researchers conduct human-centric
  threat modeling.

- Understanding how immigrant generations teach each other online security and
  privacy practices.

- Understanding how teens reason about computer security and privacy.

## Biography

I have been a professor at Brigham Young University since 2004. Prior to that I
was a professor at the University of Oregon. I received my PhD from the
University of Southern California in 1997, where I was advised by Dr. Deborah
Estrin. I was also very fortunate to work with Lixia Zhang, Scott Shenker, and
Bob Braden. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford
University.

One of the beautiful things about academia is you can change your research
interests over time. I originally started in networking, with a focus on
multicast and resource reservations. Over time this led to research in
peer-to-peer networking and wireless networks. Later in my career I switched to
usable security and privacy. What draws me to this area is the focus on making
computing more centered on people and their needs.

I did not start out imagining a career in academia and feel lucky to have found
my way here, because I enjoy helping students grow and reach their potential. I
highly recommend figuring out life as you live it. Don't be afraid to ask
questions and explore new things.

## Hiking and Photography

This is what I love to do in my spare time.
